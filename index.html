 This article analyses the gig economy's evolution, specifically in the context of service platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 It demonstrates the features of gig economy work such as short-term contracts, and requirement for. This paper addresses the challenges
 and motivations faced by gig workers with its focus on employment vagueness and labour rights. Furthermore, this paper also provides
 insight into the gig economy aim for job stability, work conditions and rules and regulations.

  <p id="Introduction_InText">
  Covid 19 had a devasting impact on all individuals around the world.<a href="#ref1">(Wellcome.org,2021)</a>. More specifically individuals 
  in the gig economy were severely impacted. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted the gig economy, 
  revealing vulnerabilities in the work lives of millions worldwide. <a href="#ref5">(Yanning Li, Shi Tracy
   Xu, Yitong Yu, Robert Meadows, 2022)</a>. Workers, such as taxi drivers, 
  delivery drivers, and contract workers face unique challenges without the traditional means of employment 
  protections or consistent income. This paper will examine the pandemic of Covid-19 and its impact upon 
  job stability, job security for gig economy workers, with its focus on
  shifts in demand, risks in working and the lack of benefits which can be fixed by reforms. It will explore 
  policy responses and structures needed to support workers and aims at negating problems within the markets, 
  with proposals for enhancing stability in a post-pandemic gig economy.

<h3 id="Job Instability">Job Instability</h3>
 <p id="JobInstability_InText">
 One of the main challenges created by Covid-19 was instability in jobs.<a href="#ref2">(Desmond Tutu Ayentimi & John Burgess, 2021)</a>. Gig economy work in general is unpredictable 
 and irregular.  This can be seen by figure 13, as the highest percentages of frequency in involvement is either 2 or 3 times a week or a 
 ‘one off’ job illustrating that these jobs will either be very rare or only occur as a ‘once off’. Furthermore, the length of these jobs is
 also usually short-term with individuals filling in roles due to shifts in demand or seasonal changes. This can be seen by the change in 
 taxi services which fell from 42% to 16% during the pandemic.<a href="#ref3">(University of Chicago, 2021)</a>. This demonstrates that this significant 
 decline will hurt workers who depend on these roles for their main income, thereby leaving them with little financial support due to the 
 lack of traditional benefits and protection in gig work. In addition, workers who relied on demand from consumption-based services like 
 Uber, Just Eat and Deliveroo would lack substitutes for their primary work as most of their alternatives are within the gig economy which 
 were also suffering from a lack of demand. <a href="#ref2">(Desmond Tutu Ayentimi & John Burgess, 2021)</a>. Whilst some may argue that deliveries increased, these roles also came 
 with greater health risks, as gig workers continued to work with little to no access to paid sick leave if they caught the illness or any 
 means of job security. Therefore, everyday workers took a risk as they had no choice but to work to make a living as opposed to others who 
 were able to adapt and adopt the work from home lifestyle. This demonstrates the volatile nature of gig economy work during events such as 
 the pandemic.<a href="#ref10">(Doe, J., 2023)</a>. As a result, these workers, were unable to contribute to the economy as they no longer received an income 
 which they could spend back into the economy preventing growth and further worsening the demand within the economy which was already falling 
 due to people being under lockdown leading to a greater negative multiplier effect.<a href="#ref11">(Pettinger, T., 2020)</a>. In general, gig workers faced 
 greater economic insecurity, and these challenges sparked a conversation about the need for stronger labour protections for gig economy 
 participants, especially given their essential role during such emergencies.

 <h3 id="Job Security">Job Security</h3>
  <p id="JobSecurity_InText">     
    In addition, workers are also employed by zero-hour contracts and with lockdowns and shifts in consumer behaviour, demand for services 
    like public transport dropped by as much as 80% in some areas, drastically reducing the income of drivers. 
    <a href="#ref6">(Government of Canada, S.C., 2020)</a>. Many gig workers rely on these jobs as their main source of income, so 
    the abrupt drop in demand for certain services led to severe financial insecurity. <a href="#ref6">(Government of Canada, S.C., 2020)</a>.
    In contrast, delivery services surged in demand, leading some workers to switch sectors; however, this shift in roles
    was not accessible to all and often came with a need for additional resources, like delivery bags, bikes, certain requirements 
    and the learning curve of new platforms, which due to the pandemic meant that resources were limited, and these changes would take a while. <a href="#ref6">(Government of Canada, S.C., 2020)</a>

  <h3 id="Reforms">Reforms</h3>
            <p id="Reforms_InText">
            
          Methods to reform the gig economy have been introduced through new legislation in which gig workers are classified as employees. <a href="#ref7">(Just Eat Takeaway.com, 2021)</a>
          This, therefore, legislates these workers to sick pay, minimum wage and other benefits ensuring that these workers are seen as employees.
          <a href="#ref7">(Just Eat Takeaway.com, 2021)</a>. In 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that Uber drivers must be seen and treated as workers and be granted labour rights 
          such as minimum wage and holiday pay. This decision as a result continues to impact gig work legislation across Europe. <a href="#ref4">(Butler. S, 2021)</a> 
          This thereby negates all the negatives of being a gig economy worker as the effects of covid 19 would not influence these individuals as they 
          have the same rights as normal workers and therefore are treated in the manner as workers.

 <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
  <p id="Conclusion_InText">
    
   In conclusion, the Covid-19 pandemic revealed the fragile and defenceless protections of the gig economy by causing irreparable damage to the economy. 
   <a href="#ref8">(Penn Presents, 2020)</a>. This pandemic was able to display the instability of the gig economy as workers in an instant were left without an income 
   and uncertain of when it would go back to normal.<a href="#ref10">(Penn Presents, 2020)</a>. Furthermore, these workers were also unable to transition to alternative
   jobs as these jobs were either too similar or there were no other substitutes available at the time.<a href="#ref1">(Wellcome.org,2021)</a>.  As a result, the pandemic was 
   able to expose the problems within the gig economy and create action for change.  Schemes such as furlough and covid recovery loans displayed the need
   for measures to support gig economy workers however these measures were only temporary and did not continue after the pandemic. <a href="#ref9">(GOV.UK, 2020)</a>
   As these events occurred, they displayed the unique role of gig workers and the need for a change in labour laws to fix these problems.
